## This, That, Here and There in Turkish

### This and That


Want to learn how to say "this" and "that" in Turkish?

In Turkish, we use '**bu**' for '**this**'. We  also interchangeably use **şu** for ‘**this**’ as well. “**This**” in Turkish depends on how close or far you are from what you're describing.

Imagine you are at the beach and want to describe what you see. If you want to talk about the sand "**This** is sand" would be "**bu** kümdür". 

When talking about something closer like the water nearby, you would use '**şu**', as in “**şu** denizdir” (**this** is a sea). If you are referring to something far like the sun, it would be appropriate to use ‘**o**’, so "**that** is the sun" would be “**o** güneştir”.

💡 

To describe things very close to us we use '**bu**/********this********', for things near us we use ‘**şu**/**This**’, and for things at a distance we use ‘**o**/**that**’.

Technically both ’**bu**’ and ’**şu**’ are equivalent to ‘**this**’, but their use changes based on **proximity** to what is being described.

# Here and There


Turkish is a logical language with few surprises and predictable structure unlike English. We'll build on what we've learned so far to learn about 'here' and 'there'.

Everything connects in Turkish. It is pretty much like building with LEGO bricks. We have seen that 'this' is "bu" or  "şu" and 'that' is "o".Now to spice things up adding the suffix "**rada**" changes **this** to **here** and **that** to **there**.

When adding `rada` to this(`bu`) it becomes here (`burada`) or this(`su`) becomes (`şurada`), by the same token `there` becomes `there` → `orada`.

So if someone asks where they should sit, you can say either **burada**(here)**, şurada**(here(near)) ****or **orada**(there(far)).

💡

 Add the suffix “**rada**” to **bu**, **şu**, or **o** to indicate location.
 **burada** → here(exactly here) 
 **şurada**  → here(near)
 **orada**   → there(far)

# Burada vs Burası


### What is the difference?

> **Burada** → is used to describe a location point. 
******************Burası →****************** refers to specific area or vicinity.

💡 **If** burada ************************is a point,************************ burası **********************is an area.**********************
