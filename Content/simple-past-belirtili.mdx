## Simple past tense -DI and -DU ( belirtili geçmiş zaman )
---
Simple past tense in Turkish is actually very simple :).

The suffix that used in the past tense of nouns, verbs or an adjectives is generally -**DI** or -**DU**.
    
    - **D** → `d` or `t` ( Rule of **f-s-t-k-ç-ş-h-p** )

    - **I**   → `ı` or `i` ( Vowel harmony i.e ease of pronunciation )   

    - **U**  → `u` or `ü` ( Vowel harmony i.e ease of pronunciation )

Don’t be overwhelmed by this formula. The image below summarizes it all.

        - In this case **no need** to consider `vowel harmony` or `f-s-t-k-ç-ş-h-p` rules, just add **idi** to any noun or adjective.
