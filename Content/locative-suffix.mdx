Why do we have **-da** and **-de**?

- It is because of `vowel harmony`. If the last vowel of the word is either `a-ı-o-u` → d**a**,
if it is `e-i-ö-ü` → d**e.**

Why do we have **-ta** and **-te**?

- It is for the ease of pronunciation. Try saying uçak**da**  and uçak**ta.** Which one was easier to say? When using **-ta** or **-ta** it becomes softer to say. Less friction 😎.
- Vowel harmony also applies here to determine whether is is -t**a** or -t**e.**
