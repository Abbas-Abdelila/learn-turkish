## Plurals in Turkish - Çokluk Eki
---

Let us take a look at how we can make words plural. It is the same like English in the sense that it comes at the end of the word.

The letters that correspond to **s** , **es** or **ies** in English for plurality are **lar** and **ler**.

Let us see this in play. 

| English | English Plural | Turkish | Turkish Plural |
|---------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Car | Car**s** | Araba | Araba**lar** |
| Flower | Flower**s** | Çiçek | Çiçek**ler** |
| Book | Book**s** | Kitap | Kitap**lar** |
| House | Hous**es** | Ev | Ev**ler** |
| Tree | Tree**s** | Ağaç | Ağaç**lar** |
| Bird | Bird**s** | Kuş | Kuş**lar** |
| Chair | Chair**s** | Sandalye | Sandalye**ler** |
| Friend | Friend**s** | Arkadaş | Arkadaş**lar** |
| Cat | Cat**s** | Kedi | Kedi**ler** |
| Dog | Dog**s** | Köpek | Köpek**ler** |
| Baby | Bab**ies** | Bebek | Bebek**ler** |
| City | Cit**ies** | Şehir | Şehir**ler** |
| Butterfly | Butterfl**ies** | Kelebek | Kelebek**ler** |


You might be wondering when do we use **ler**  and when do we use **lar**?

In Turkish, for ease of pronunciation we pay attention to the **last vowel** of the word being in harmony with the **suffix** added. 

 
> 📌 If the last vowel is either `a` , `ı` ,`o` ,`u` then **lar** is added to the word to make it plural. 

> 📌 If the last vowel is either `e`, `i`, `ö` `ü` then **ler** is added to the word to make it plural.


|        Last Vowel |           Plural suffix |
| --- | --- |
| <span className="text-blue-500 font-semibold">a-ı-o-u</span> | -**lar** |
| <span className="text-blue-500 font-semibold">e-i-ö-ü</span> | -**ler** |


That’s why Cars is Arab<span className="text-blue-500">a</span>**lar** and Flowers is Çiç<span className="text-blue-500">e</span>k**ler**.

### Using “ler” and “lar” with Numbers

When a word is preceded by a number in Turkish, we **do not** use the suffixes -**lar** and -**ler.**



> Five Books → Beş kitaplar ❌ → Beş kitap     ✅

Why is that?
It is because the number **beş** is already enough to indicate it is plural in Turkish grammar so it is wrong to add suffix to the word.


📌
You will probably be tempted to say "dört arabalar" instead of "dört araba". It takes conscious effort to avoid not adding the "lar/ler". It will eventually become a habit after sometime.
