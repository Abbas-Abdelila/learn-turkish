## Plurals in Turkish - Çokluk Eki
---

Let us take a look at how we can make words plural. It is the same like English in the sense that it comes at the end of the word.

The letters that correspond to `s` , `es` or `ies` in English for plurality are **lar** and ********ler.********

Let us see this in play. 

<aside>
💡 
Car        →     Car**s**                                Flower   →  Flowers
Araba    →     Araba******lar******                         Çiçek     →  Çiçek******ler******

</aside>

You might be wondering when do we use **************ler**************  and when do we use **********lar**********?

In Turkish, for ease of pronunciation we pay attention to the **last vowel** of the word being in harmony with the **suffix** added. 

<aside>
💡 
📌 If the last vowel is either `a` , `ı` ,`o` ,`u` then ********lar******** is added to the word to make it plural. 

📌 If the last vowel is either `e`, `i`, `ö` `ü` then **ler** is added to the word to make it plural.

</aside>

|        Last Vowel |           Plural suffix |
| --- | --- |
| <span className="text-blue-500">a-ı-o-u</span> | -**lar** |
| <span className="text-blue-500">e-i-ö-ü</span> | -**ler** |


That’s why Cars is Arab<span className="text-blue-500">a</span>**lar** and Flowers is Çiç<span className="text-blue-500">e</span>k******ler.******

### Using “ler” and “lar” with Numbers

When a word is preceded by a number in Turkish, we **do not** use the suffixes -**lar** and -**ler.**

<aside>
💡 
Five Books  

→ Beş kitaplar ❌

→ Beş kitap     ✅

Why is that?
It is because the number **beş** is already indicates its plural and to avoid redundancy.

</aside>

📌
You will probably be like dört arabalar when you should instead say dört araba.It takes conscious  effort to avoid it.
