# Have and Don’t Have in Turkish


Let's talk about expressing possession in Turkish, using the words '**var**' and '**yok**'. These two crucial words indicate whether you have or don't have something. They typically come **at the end** of a sentence.

To understand their meanings, '**var**' translates to "**exists**", while '**yok**' means "**doesn't exist**". 

So when you say you own something in Turkish, you are literally saying it exists. 


For example, if you want to express that you have a car in Turkish, you'd say "benim arabam var." 

Let us break down this sentence and understand what it means.

Ben is "I"

Ben**im** is "My"

araba is "car"

araba**m** is "my car", the suffix "-Im" added shows the possesive relationship between "ben" and "araba"

If the last letter is a vowel, only -m is added (as in the case of araba - araba**m**)

If the last letter is not a vowel, the table below shows how the suffix "-Im" is added.

| Last Vowel of the Word | Possessive Suffix | Example |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| a, ı                   | -ım               | kitap → kitab**ım** (my book) |
| e, i                   | -im               | ev → ev**im** (my house) |
| o, u                   | -um               | yol → yol**um** (my way) |
| ö, ü                   | -üm               | göz → göz**üm** (my eye) |


 



> Ben**im** araba**m** **var**” → literal translation “My car exists”<br/>
> It means → "I have a car" in English. 

> My car exists" == "I have a car" in Turkish grammar.



You may say I get ben**im** but why do we have to add suffix to the car and say araba**m.**
Shouldn’t a car be just be a car everywhere regardless of how it is used in a sentence?

Think about it this way, whenever you add a suffix to a Pronoun(Ben, sen, o, siz, biz), you are saying I have initiated(opened) something so the way to end(close) it is with another appropriate closer.

When I say Ben**im**, I initiated a relationship so I will close it with some closer suffix.
So Ben**im** araba**m,** Sen**in** ev**in**, O**nun** ev**i**

Think of it like opening and closing a parenthesis. ( ). 

The aphorism below sums it up. 

> If you open, you've got to close.

<br/>


> In Turkish language structure matters especially towards the end (as it has suffix based grammar) where key meaning is determined with either “**var**” denoting existence thus confirming possession or “**yok**” indicating non-existence hence clarifying lack of possession in our case.


So if you are the type that sometimes hums the end a word or sentence when you are not sure, it may let you down in Turkish.
