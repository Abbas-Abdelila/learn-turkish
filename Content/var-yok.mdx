# Have and Don’t Have in Turkish
---

Let's talk about expressing possession in Turkish, using the words '**var**' and '**yok**'. These two crucial words indicate whether you have or don't have something. They typically come **at the end** of a sentence.

To understand their meanings, '**var**' translates to "**exists**", while '**yok**' means "**doesn't exist**". So when you say you own something in Turkish, you are literally saying it exists. The **pronoun** is where **ownership** is expressed with **suffix**.

For example, if you want to express that you have a car in Turkish, you'd say "benim arabam var." Here, 'var' confirms that the car exists for you. But if there isn’t any car for your disposal then it would be expressed as “benim arabam yok.”

<aside>
💡 The logic of Turkish is like
”Ben**im** araba**m** ***var***” → literal translation “My car exists”
 Actually means → I have a car. 

My car exists == I have a car.

</aside>

In these sentences ‘ben’ stands for I and by adding suffix ‘im’ we get benim which is My (mine). Similarly ,car is araba in turkish but to show that its yours we add ‘m’ making it araba**m**.

<aside>
💡 You may say I get ben**im** but why do we have to add suffix to the car and say araba**m.**
Shouldn’t a car be just be a car everywhere regardless of how it is used in a sentence?

At this level, I want you to look at it this way. 
Whenever you add a suffix to a Pronoun(Ben, sen, o, siz, biz), you are saying I have initiated sth so the way to finish it is with another appropriate closer.

When I say Ben****im****, I initiated a relationship so I will close it with some closer suffix.
So Ben**im** araba****m,**** Sen**in** ev**in**, O**nun** ev**i**

Think of it like opening and closing a parenthesis. ( ). If you open then you have to close it.


</aside>

> In Turkish language structure matters especially towards the end where key meaning lies with either “**var**” denoting existence thus confirming possession or “**yok**” indicating non-existence hence clarifying lack of possession.

So if you are the type that sometimes hums the end a word or sentence when you are not sure, Turkish will not let that slide 🚧.
