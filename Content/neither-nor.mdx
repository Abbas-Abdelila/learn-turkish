## Neither nor  ne…ne in Turkish

The Turkish equivalent of “**neither…nor…** or **neither…neither…**” is “**ne…ne (de)…**”

Structurally and logically **ne…ne (de)** is closer to **"neither…neither"** in English. Except in Turkish *either…or* also has similar structure. 

I mean Turkish is more consistent with this "grammar" thing.  

The **(de)** is optional you can just **skip** it.

In spoken Turkish, people tend to leave it and say “**ne…ne…**”

Here are sentences constructed using “**ne…ne (de)**”

- The weather is **neither** hot **nor** cold.
    - Hava **ne** sıcak **ne (de)** soğuk.
