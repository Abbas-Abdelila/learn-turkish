# Vowel Harmony in Turkish

**Vowel harmony** is one of the fundamental pillars of the Turkish grammar. 

It aims to create a flow and smooth transition when pronouncing words and phrases.

<aside>
💡 Two main vowel groups are present in Turkish.

1. **e**-**i**-**ö**-**ü →** front vowels
2. **a**-**ı**-**o**-**u →** back vowels
****

📝 This classification is based on the position of the tongue and the shape of the lips when pronouncing the vowels.

For the sake of ease in pronunciation, all the grammars in Turkish adhere to this principle. You will not come across words that would have sudden sound inflections but rather smooth ones. 

let's take the word "**ev**" which means "*house*" in Turkish. To say “my house”, the suffix that makes it possessive is (-<span className="text-blue-600">I</span>m).

my house → **ev**<span className="text-blue-600">i</span>m  as **e** and <span className="text-blue-600">i</span> belong to the same vowel group. 

my phone → **telefon**<span className="text-blue-600">u</span>m as **o** and <span className="text-blue-600">u</span> belong to the same vowel group. 

It would be cumbersome to pronounce **ev**<span className="text-blue-600">ı</span>m or **telefon**<span className="text-blue-600">ü</span>m as "<span className="text-blue-600">ı</span>" and "<span className="text-blue-600">ü</span>" are from different vowel group.

It is more like a protocol to how suffixes are added to roots.
