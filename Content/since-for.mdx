## Since… -DAn beri and For.. DIr in Turkish
---

I am going to explain to you how you can say or write sentences like “I play football since high school or I live in San Francisco since 2019”. 

We will also learn for how long we have been doing something in Turkish. 

Let us start by learning few things about “Since”. (since it is important 😎)

Turkish is all about suffix. The suffix for `(ever) since` is -**DAn beri,** where

- D → d or t
- A → a or e

It expresses the duration of time passed since an event.
This suffix is used to explain the time related `since` but not the reason related since. 

| Last Vowel  | Last Letter | Since |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a-ı-o-u | one of [ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ] | -tan beri |
| a-ı-o-u | one of [ other letters ] | -dan beri |
| e-i-ö-ü | one of [ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ] | -ten beri |
| e-i-ö-ü | one of [ other letters ] | -den beri |

Examples

Naval Ravikant’a rastladıktan beri düşüncelerim değişti.

My thinking has changed ever since I came across Naval Ravikant.  

Now let us see `For` as in I have been waiting for this for years.

The suffix is -DIr where 

- D → d or t
- I →  i, ı, u, ü

They are added to adverbs of time like

- **haftalardır** (for weeks)
- **aylardır** (for months)
- **yıllardır** (for years)
- **saattir** (for hours)
- **dakikadır** (for minutes)

| Last Vowel | Last Letter | For … |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a-ı | one of [ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ] | -tır |
| a-ı | one of [ other letters ] | -dır |
| o-u | one of [ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ] | -tur |
| o-u | one of [ other letters ] | -dur |
| e-i | one of [ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ] | -tir |
| e-i | one of [ other letters ] | -dir |
| ö-ü | one of [ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ] | -tür |
| ö-ü | one of [ other letters ] | -dür |
