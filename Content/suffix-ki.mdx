  🎯  2. “-ki” can also be used to avoid redundancy be used as a reference to the subject being discussed.

    
### 3. “-ki” when used to emphasize something you know or make a point.
    
    
    It is the cutest use case of “-ki.” 
    
    It is like “-to begin with.”

    I didn’t invite Berk to the party (in the first place / to begin with / to start with).
    
    It is usually used in a sweet tone and has a very warm feel to it. 
    
    Personally it is one of my favorite expressions in Turkish.
    
### 4. “-ki” when used as connector when describing something with exaggeration.
