## Expressing Opinions… Bence, Sence, Bizce Sizce
---

We can also state our opinions in Turkish using the general structure **********Pronoun +********** c**********A**********, where **A → a** or **e** (vowel harmony).  

Let us see it explained in the table below.


| Pronoun +  Suffix | Opinion suffix | English Translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ben + ce | Bence | In my opinion / I think |
| Sen + ce | Sence | In your opinion / You think |
| On + ca  ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Biz + ce | Bizce | In our opinion / We think |
| Siz + ce | Sizce | In your opinion / You think |
| Onlar + ca  ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

*sing.* → Singular

*pl.* → Plural

❌ → `Onca` and `Onlarca` don’t express opinion but rather number. It is caused because the number 10 in Turkish is  "**on**". `Onca` and `onlarca` both mean `tens` as in the sentence 

“Onlarca insan her gün buraya geliyor.”

“Tens of people come to this place everyday” (This is literal translation, it means many people come to this place everyday)   

So we don’t use them for opinion in this sense since they **already** have been defined and overlap with a **number**.

Here are some examples of how to use these structures to express opinions:

- **In my opinion**, Turkish is a very logical language.
    - **Bence** Türkçe çok mantıklı bir dil.
- Do **you think** it might rain today?
    - **Sence** bugün yağmur yağabilir mi?
- When do **you think** we should finish the lesson?
    - **Sizce** dersi ne zaman bitirelim?
- **We think** that explaining how something can benefit people is more effective than trying to persuade them.
    - **Bizce** insanlar ikna etmek yerine nasıl onlara yararlı olacağını anlatmak daha etkili.
