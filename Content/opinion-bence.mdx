## Expressing Opinions… Bence, Sence, Bizce Sizce
---

We can also state our opinions in Turkish using the general structure **********Pronoun +********** c**********A**********, where **A → a** or **e** (vowel harmony).  

Let us see it explained in the table below.


| Pronoun EN | Pronoun TR | Opinion +  Suffix | Opinion suffix | English Translation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I | Ben | Ben + ce | Bence | In my opinion / I think |
| You(sing.) | Sen | Sen + ce | Sence | In your opinion / You think |
| He/She/It | O | On + ca  ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| We | Biz  | Biz + ce | Bizce | In our opinion / We think |
| You(pl.) | Siz | Siz + ce | Sizce | In your opinion / You think |
| They | Onlar | Onlar + ca  ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

*sing.* → Singular

*pl.* → Plural

❌ → `Onca` and `Onlarca` don’t express opinion but rather number. It is caused because the number 10 is on. `Onca` and `onlarca` mean `tens` as in the sentence “Tens of thousands of people come everyday to this place.”   

So we don’t use them for opinion in this sense since they already have been defined for numbers.

Here are some examples of how to use these structures to express opinions:

- **In my opinion**, Turkish is a very logical language.
    - **Bence** Türkçe çok mantıklı bir dil.
- Do **you think** it might rain today?
    - **Sence** bugün yağmur yağabilir mi?
- When do **you think** we should finish the lesson?
    - **Sizce** dersi ne zaman bitirelim?
- **We think** that explaining how something can benefit people is more effective than trying to persuade them.
    - **Bizce** insanlar ikna etmek yerine nasıl onlara iyi olacağını anlatmak daha etkili.
