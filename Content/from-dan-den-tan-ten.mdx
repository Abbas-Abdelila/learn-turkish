# From (-dan -den -tan -ten) Ayrılma Hali Eki

In Turkish, "from" is a suffix that can be -**dan**, -**den**, -**tan**, -**ten**. 

You might think, so do I have to remember all of these? The good answer is not at all. They are basically the same thing and have a formula.

Previously, we saw the **f,s,t,k,ç,ş,h,p** and vowel harmony. These two are one of the core principles of the Turkish grammar.

| Last Vowel  | Last Letter | From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a-ı-o-u | one of `[ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ]` | **-tan** |
| a-ı-o-u | one of `[ other letters ]` | **-dan** |
| e-i-ö-ü | one of `[ f, s, t, k, ç, ş, h, p ]` | **-ten** |
| e-i-ö-ü | one of `[ other letters ]` | **-den** |

`other letters` - a, b, c, d, e, g, ğ, ı, i, j, l, m, n, o, ö, r, u, ü, v, y, z.

Examples:

- **from** distance→ uzak**tan**
- **from** Europe → Avrupa'**dan**
- **from** the office → ofis**ten**
- **from** Turkey →Türkiye'**den**

   

When using the word 'from' in sentences like:

- I am coming **from** the hospital ⇒ Ben hastane**den** geliyorum.

     *hastane* → *hospital* 🏥

- He is **from** Palermo  . ⇒ O Palermo’**dan**dır.

You add -dan, -den, -tan or -ten based on the ending of the noun or verb. It shows leaving a place or belonging to a group just like you use 'from' in English.

 The -DAn suffix doesn’t exclusively describe belonging or source. It can also express other things based on the context. If you want to know look at the sentence below.

“I am asking **out of** curiosity” translates to “merak**tan** soruyorum”

📌 Two things to know for now would be

 1.  There is no one to one relation between English and Turkish grammar.

1. Turkish by design express a lot with few in comparison to English and does it because suffixes can have multiple functions and are powerful in combination.
