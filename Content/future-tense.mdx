# Future Tense: Gelecek zaman -acak -ecek

When looking at the future tense of verbs in Turkish, the English `will` equivalent suffix is -AcAk where A could be either `a` or `e`.

> -AcAk, where A â†’ a | e
> 

| Last Vowel of root verb | Future Tense |
| --- | --- |
| a-Ä±-o-u | -acak |
| e-i-Ã¶-Ã¼ | -ecek |

The difference in future tense between English and Turkish is

- `Will` comes before the verb in English, while in Turkish -acak or -ecek  suffix is added to the root verb.

For example, 

â€¦.will comeâ€¦. â†’ â€¦.gel**ecek**.

â€¦.will doâ€¦. â†’ â€¦..yap**acak**.

â€¦.will travelâ€¦ â†’ â€¦.gez**ecek**.

â€¦.will achieveâ€¦ â†’ â€¦.baÅŸar**acak**.

 ðŸ“Œ One thing to keep in mind ðŸ§  is when the last letter of the root verb is a vowel, as in the verb uyumak(to sleep), the root is uyu + acak, we have a condition of two vowels coming next to each other `u` and `a`.  To accomodate this â€˜yâ€™ comes in between as a mediator making â€¦.will sleepâ€¦ â†’ uyuyacak.

More examples,

â€¦.will callâ€¦ â†’ â€¦.arayacak.

â€¦.will inviteâ€¦ â†’ â€¦.davet edecek.

â€¦.will watchâ€¦ â†’ â€¦.izleyecek.

â€¦.will tryâ€¦ â†’ â€¦.deneyecek.

â€¦.will renewâ€¦ â†’ â€¦.yenileyecek.

ðŸš¨ There are two verbs that are exception.

- demek(to say)
- yemek(to eat)

In these two cases the future tense of the verbs `e` of the root is dropped and replaced by `i`.

When `i` becomes the last letter of the root, we have a situation where `i` + ecek, resulting in `ie` two vowels coming consecutively. We add separator â€˜yâ€™ in between them.

Vowels coming next to each other in Turkish is kind of like the same pole of magnets facing each other. They push each other.

â€¦will sayâ€¦. â†’ diyecek

â€¦.will eatâ€¦. â†’ yiyecek

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact:

> Even the very word future in Turkish origins from the verb gelmek(to come). The future being what will come. 
-Gelecek
